Classic Snake Game using Python and Turtle

This project is a modern rendition of the classic Snake game, developed using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game is designed to replicate the nostalgic experience of the original Snake game while leveraging the simplicity and flexibility of Python programming.

Key Features:

Smooth Gameplay: The snake moves smoothly on a grid, growing longer as it consumes food. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the snake's length and speed increase.
Responsive Controls: Players can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys, ensuring a responsive and intuitive gaming experience.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, with points awarded based on the number of food items consumed.
Game Over Condition: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edges of the screen, providing a challenging yet fair difficulty curve.
Customizable Settings: The game's speed, screen size, and colors can be easily adjusted in the code, allowing for a personalized gaming experience.
This project serves as an excellent introduction to Python game development and provides a solid foundation for those looking to explore more advanced concepts in game design. The use of the Turtle library makes it a great choice for beginners, offering visual feedback that aids in understanding how the game functions.
